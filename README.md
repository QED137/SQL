# SQL Query Project: Business Expansion Analysis

This repository is part of my coursework at [WBS Coding School](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/). The project focuses on analyzing data to support a business decision regarding the expansion of a fictitious e-commerce company, **Eniac**, into the Brazilian market.

## Project Overview

This project explores the potential expansion of **Eniac**, a fictional e-commerce company, into the Brazilian market, using data provided by **Magist**, another fictitious Brazilian e-commerce company. The analysis aimed to determine whether **Magist**'s operations align with **Eniac**'s standards and to assess the viability of entering the Brazilian market.

The analysis involved developing and running SQL queries to extract and analyze data relevant to the Brazilian market. These queries were designed to provide insights into various aspects of the market, such as customer behavior, sales trends, and competitive landscape.

All queries were developed and tested using **MySQL Workbench**, a versatile tool that facilitated the design of the queries and visualization of the database schema.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

1. **Evaluate Customer Satisfaction**: Analyze customer reviews to gauge the reputation and service quality of **Magist**.
2. **Assess High-End Order Handling**: Examine **Magist**’s capability in managing high-end orders, particularly those over €500.
3. **Investigate Delivery Performance**: Review the timeliness of deliveries, focusing on delayed shipments and their impact on customer satisfaction.

## Key Findings

- **Customer Reviews**: Analysis of customer feedback revealed significant concerns regarding **Magist**'s ability to meet **Eniac**'s high standards, particularly in areas such as delivery delays and product handling.
- **High-End Orders**: A substantial portion of orders over €500 were identified, with **Magist** struggling to maintain the premium standards expected for such transactions.
- **Delayed Deliveries**: An alarming 76% of deliveries were delayed, highlighting a critical weakness in **Magist**'s logistics operations.



## Conclusion

The analysis concluded that **Magist** does not meet the operational standards required by **Eniac** for a successful market entry into Brazil. The recommendation is to explore alternative logistics providers to better support **Eniac**'s potential expansion into the Brazilian market.

## Repository Contents

- **Database Schema**: The schema file (`schema_database.pdf`) outlines the structure of the database provided by **Magist**, including the tables, columns, and relationships.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL script (`business_question_n_answer.sql`) contains the queries used to extract and analyze data relevant to the business expansion proposal.
- **Presentation Slides**: The findings and supportive arguments presented to the CEO of the fictitious company, **Eniac**.

## How to Use

1. **Review the Database Schema**:
   - The schema provides a detailed overview of the database structure. Understanding the relationships and data types is crucial before running any queries.

2. **Run the SQL Query**:
   - Use the provided `query.sql` file to execute the queries against the database. These queries are tailored to answer specific business questions related to the expansion into the Brazilian market.

3. **Analyze the Results**:
   - Once the queries are executed, analyze the retrieved data to draw conclusions regarding the feasibility of the business expansion. The insights gathered will be critical in making an informed decision.

## Learning Outcomes

This project aims to demonstrate the following:

- **Advanced SQL Querying**: Expertise in crafting and optimizing SQL queries to extract valuable insights from large datasets.
- **Business Analysis**: Application of SQL to address real-world business questions, helping to inform strategic decisions.
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Working in a group of four, we collaborated effectively to analyze data and present our findings to the CEO.
- **Presentation Skills**: Summarizing complex data insights and presenting them in a clear and concise manner to support or challenge business proposals.

Through this project, I developed a deeper understanding of how data-driven decisions are made in a business context, particularly in the realm of market expansion.
