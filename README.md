# SQL Query for Large Database Analysis

This repository is part of my coursework at [WBS Coding School](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/). The project involves crafting and executing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from a large database. Due to the substantial size of the database, I am sharing the database schema along with the SQL query used for analysis, rather than the full dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, the primary focus is on querying a large-scale database to retrieve specific information efficiently. The dataset in question is too large to be included directly in this repository, so I have provided the database schema and the SQL queries used for data extraction and analysis.

All queries were developed and tested using **MySQL Workbench**, a powerful tool for managing MySQL databases. MySQL Workbench provided an intuitive interface for designing the queries and visualizing the database schema.

## Repository Contents

- **Database Schema**: The schema file (`schema.sql`) outlines the structure of the database, including the tables, columns, and relationships.
- **SQL Query**: The SQL script (`query.sql`) contains the query designed to retrieve the necessary data from the database.

## How to Use

1. **Review the Database Schema**:
   - The schema provides a detailed overview of the database structure. It is crucial to understand the relationships and the data types involved before running any queries.

2. **Run the SQL Query**:
   - Use the provided `query.sql` file to execute the query against the database. This query is optimized for the specific structure of the provided schema.

3. **Analyze the Results**:
   - Once the query is executed, you can analyze the retrieved data for insights. Depending on the size of your dataset, you may need to further refine the query or break down the analysis into smaller parts.

## Prerequisites

To work with this project, you should have the following:

- **SQL Server**: A working SQL server where you can load the schema and run the query.
- **MySQL Workbench**: The queries in this project were developed and tested using MySQL Workbench, so having this tool will help you replicate the results and modify the queries if needed.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge**: Familiarity with SQL syntax and database management to modify and execute the provided scripts.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate:

- Proficiency in writing complex SQL queries.
- Understanding of database schemas and relationships.
- Ability to work with large datasets efficiently.
- Application of SQL in real-world data analysis scenarios.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or find any issues with the provided SQL scripts, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
